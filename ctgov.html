                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>The main goals of the project were to move the current website off a very old system and onto a
                        new one. In addition, we updated the design and branding to bring in more modern elements and to
                        make it mobile friendly.</p>

                    <p>We began doing research learning and understanding why we were changing the site, who the
                        audience was, what the stakeholders were looking for, what changes did they want to see and what
                        was working and what wasn't.</p>

                    <p>Since the site hadn’t been updated in about 15 years, there was old and outdated code and though
                        it was accessible, didn’t include all the advances made with website accessibility.</p>

                    <h2>The Approach</h2>
                    <p>We wanted to take a different approach with the update what we called the unified approach. It
                        was similar to the concept for Gov.uk. They blended the lines between their government entities
                        so citizens didn’t need to know anything about government but only the service they were looking
                        for. Everything had the same look and feel. It created a seamless interaction for the citizens.
                    </p>

                    <p>We were lucky enough to speak with a few from the team who worked on Gov.uk to learn about their
                        process and methodology. It was a wonderful and exciting experience and we learned a lot.</p>

                    <p>From those calls and meetings, we began organizing the content under new headings. The goal was
                        to be able to create categories to organize the content in a simpler, more meaningful way. </p>

                    <p>We wanted to take the site into a direction where links were large and obvious. The content would
                        start generic and then funnel the user down to more specific categories under the main headings.

                    <h2>Branding</h2>
                    <p>We also worked with the state and tourism on creating a new brand. It stemmed from a promotion
                        tourism was working on and the direction they wanted to take the state from a marketing
                        perspective. The brand included a new logo, color scheme and fonts. We created a few style tiles
                        with some different elements keeping with the same general theme.</p>

                    <h2>Architecture</h2>
                    <p>To get started with the process, we conducted a complete content audit of the website. We mapped
                        out every page and every section. We looked at what pages weren't needed anymore, what needed to
                        be updated and any new content that was needed. We looked at google analytics and what pages had
                        the most traffic and what didn't. Once we reviewed everything, we created a site map. </p>

                    <h2>Getting to a Final Design</h2>
                    <p>The site map was key to understanding all the content we had to represent and understanding the
                        content provided guidance for the design elements needed.</p>

                    <p>We went through many designs and layouts. I think at least 15 different version were created. We
                        tested a few designs with user groups and from the feedback, continued to make adjustments.
                        Additional changes were made with stakeholder input. </p>

                    <p>Once we came to two designs, we performed A/B testing to see which preformed better. </p>

                    <p>Both designs tested well with the blue boxed design performing slightly better. Based on that and
                        stakeholders input, the final design chosen was the boxed layout. </p>

                <div class="small-12 cell">
                    <p>At the time we launched, the content management system we were working with was purchased by
                        another company and became decommissioned. Since the site was pretty much ready to go, it was
                        decided to launch in the current decommissioned system. Immediately after the launch, we started
                        working on researching and procuring a new CMS. </p>

                    <p>Over the following year, we decided on a new CMS and began the process all over again. In
                        addition to moving to a new system, it was decided to give the look and feel an update as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>We identified all the pages currently on the site, analyzed the different layouts and reviewed
                        the content. Understanding what we have was key to know where we wanted to take the design
                        update. </p>

                    <p>We had been gathering and reviewing google analytics and survey feedback on how the new site was
                        performing. Some feedback we received was:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too many clicks to get through to the content</li>
                        <li>High bounce rate on second and third level pages</li>
                        <li>Users couldn’t find the information they were looking for</li>
                        <li>Difficult to use</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The main update we wanted to make was to create an easier navigation design. We reworked the site
                        architecture and identified areas we could remove, making it more streamlined. </p>

                        give users an idea for the depth of content and a reference to where they are on the site.</p>

                    <h2>Finalizing the New Design</h2>
                    <p>Once we had a few ideas agreed on by stakeholders, we conducted user testing to learn if the
                        decision we made would indeed be more useful to the user. Testing on early wireframes provided
                        some useful feedback. Some of the feedback was: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main navigation terms were confusing - not sure what would be under each one</li>
                        <li>The navigation isn’t very noticeable</li>
                        <li>It wasn’t clear when links were clicked</li>
                        <li>Featured content wasn’t noticeable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>We also got a lot of positive feedback with the updated layout vs the original blue box design.
                        Many thought it was updated and modern. Users also stated the content looked informative and
                        understood the simple language.</p>

                    <p>We made some further updates based on this testing and with stakeholder approval, we landed on a
                        final design. </p>

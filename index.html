          <p>The goal of this project was to update the state agency template. It wasnâ€™t mobile friendly or responsive
            and I wanted to incorporate some of the design elements from the RI.gov design. I started with the base of
            the main website, updated the Foundation version and enhanced the mobile menu. Another goal was to ensure
            the template was flexible enough to work with many different agencies' website content. I used the
            Foundation 4 framework and built it mobile first with responsive design. </p>

            Foundation framework for increased functionality.</p>

          <p>I worked with a talented team to build the RI.gov website mobile first using responsive design. It was the
            first state website to embrace this design concept and set the standard going forward. I worked closely with
            the creative director planning for the switch to mobile first, developing the code and adding CSS

          <p><img src="img/brand/_BAS7517_1-sm.jpg" alt="Leslie B. Mann" />I am a designer by nature. I have always had a creative mindset and growing up, I knew I wanted to do something that allowed me to be creative and explore those passions. I started in graphic design where I loved to layout magazines, brochures, designed logos, and so much more. I was curious about website design and decided to learn more about it. I have designed websites big and small, learned to code (which I thought I would never do!), learned about making websites accessible to everyone, how to guide the user through interfaces and so much more. I love creating unique and sophisticated designs that shape the users' experiences.</p>

           <p> My designer eyes are always working analyzing everything from the layout of a restaurant menu, the font choices in a book to the work-flow of purchasing products or signing up for different websites and software.</p> 
          
           <p>I love being creative. When I am not designing websites and applications, you can find me painting in watercolor, coloring intricate designs in my favorite coloring books and indulging in other crafts. I also love spending time with my family and traveling. Beach vacations are my favorite!
